# Chatify ✨: Real-Time Full-Stack Chat Application

## Executive Summary

Chatify is a high-performance, full-stack chat application engineered to provide a seamless, real-time messaging experience. This project demonstrates a robust, modern architecture using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and features custom JWT authentication, real-time communication via Socket.io, and integration with third-party services for email notifications and media handling. The platform is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, showcasing a comprehensive skill set in full-stack development.

## ✨ Features & Technical Implementation

| Feature | ⚙️ Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🔐 Custom JWT Authentication** | Implements a secure, stateless authentication system using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. The backend (`backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js`) handles user sign-up and login, hashing passwords with **bcrypt**, and issuing signed tokens. A custom middleware (`backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.js`) protects API routes by verifying the JWT on incoming requests. |
| **⚡ Real-Time Messaging** | Leverages **Socket.io** for persistent, bidirectional communication between the client and server. The server (`backend/src/lib/socket.js`) manages user connections, listens for new message events, and broadcasts messages in real-time to the appropriate recipients, ensuring instantaneous delivery. |
| **🟢 Online/Offline Presence** | Real-time presence is managed through Socket.io's connection and disconnection events. When a user connects, their status is broadcast to all other clients. The frontend UI dynamically updates to show who is currently online, enhancing user engagement. |
| **📨 Welcome Emails on Signup** | Integrates with **Resend** to send automated welcome emails upon successful user registration. This logic is handled server-side within the `signup` controller (`backend/src/emails/emailHandlers.js`), which is triggered after a new user is created in the database. |
| **🗂️ Image Uploads** | Implements seamless image sharing by integrating **Cloudinary** for cloud-based media storage. When a user sends an image, the file is securely uploaded from the client to the server, which then streams it to the Cloudinary API, returning a URL that is stored with the message in MongoDB. |
| **🎨 Modern, Responsive Frontend** | The UI is built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and the **DaisyUI** component library. This combination allows for rapid development of a beautiful, responsive, and mobile-first interface. State is managed efficiently on the client-side with **Zustand**. |
| **🚦 API Rate-Limiting** | Protects the backend from brute-force attacks and abuse by integrating **Arcjet** for intelligent rate-limiting. A dedicated middleware (`backend/src/middleware/arcjet.middleware.js`) inspects incoming requests to the authentication endpoints and enforces limits. |
| **🧰 Robust REST API** | The backend is a well-structured RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express**. It features a modular design with clear separation of concerns for routes (`/routes`), controllers (`/controllers`), and database models (`/models`), ensuring maintainability and scalability. |

### Architectural Breakdown

  * **Client-Side (Frontend)**
    The frontend is a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React**. It handles all user interface elements, routing, and client-side state.

      * **UI Components:** The interface is built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** for a modern, responsive design.
      * **State Management:** Global state, such as user authentication status and chat data, is managed with **Zustand** for a lightweight and efficient solution.
      * **API Communication:** The client communicates with the backend via a **REST API** for authentication and fetching data, using **Axios** for HTTP requests. Real-time messaging is handled through a persistent **Socket.io** connection.

  * **Server-Side (Backend)**
    The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, serving a dual purpose: providing a REST API for core functionalities and managing real-time connections.

      * **REST API:** Exposes endpoints for user authentication (`/api/auth`) and message history (`/api/messages`).
      * **Real-time Layer:** A **Socket.io** server is integrated with the Express server to manage WebSocket connections, handling real-time events like new messages, typing indicators, and user presence.
      * **Database:** **MongoDB** is used as the data store, with **Mongoose** as the ODM for defining schemas for Users and Messages.

  * **External Services**
    Chatify integrates with several external services to provide enhanced functionality:

      * **Resend:** Handles the delivery of transactional emails, such as welcome messages.
      * **Cloudinary:** Manages the storage and delivery of user-uploaded images.
      * **Arcjet:** Provides security and rate-limiting for critical API endpoints.
